## Mapping the X52/PRO  Mouse Ministick to usable Axes
A Script that by tweaking the registry, you can remap the mouse ministick of the X52/PRO to function as independent axes instead of X/Y mouse movements. 

This solution includes he X52 PRO and the non-PRO models.

### Requirements ðŸ§¾
- H.O.T.A.S, X52 (https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/space/x52-space-flight-simulator-controller.945-000025.html) or X52 Pro (https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/space/x52-pro-space-flight-simulator-controller.945-000022.html)
- Disabling the X52 Mouse Driver<br/>

### Limitations and Considerations :exclamation:
After applying the registry hack the ministick causes the mouse cursor to move on your screen, you will need to disable the associated driver.

The X52 PRO utilizes a total of seven physical axes, and its protocol supports up to eight axes. This means only one axis is available for the X/Y mouse ministick movement.

To address this limitation, you can reassign one of the physical axes. A common choice is the RZ axis, which controls the stick's twist movement typically used for rudder control. If you are using rudder pedals, this axis becomes redundant and can be repurposed for the ministick. Additionally, other axes such as the slider or rotary knobs can be considered for reassignment based on your specific needs and setup.
